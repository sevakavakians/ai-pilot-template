## üéØ How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Identify What You Need

Use this decision tree:
```
Is it about...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Business/Product? ‚Üí product/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ System Architecture? ‚Üí technical/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ How to build? ‚Üí development/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ How to run? ‚Üí operations/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ How it looks? ‚Üí design/
```

### Step 2: Fill In the Templates

Each template contains:
- **Placeholder sections** marked with `[BRACKETS]`
- **Example content** to guide you
- **Best practices** for that type of documentation
- **Update frequency** recommendations

### Step 3: Customize for Your Project

1. **Remove irrelevant sections** - Not every project needs every section
2. **Add project-specific sections** - Your project may have unique needs
3. **Adjust terminology** - Use your team's language
4. **Set review schedules** - Plan regular updates

## üìù Template Structure

Each template follows this structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

**Purpose**: Why this document exists
**Audience**: Who should read this
**Update Frequency**: How often to review/update

## Overview
High-level introduction

## Main Sections
Detailed content organized logically

## Examples
Concrete examples and code samples

## Best Practices
Recommendations and guidelines

## References
Links to related resources
```

## üîÑ Keeping Documentation Current

### Automated Updates via project-manager

The project-manager agent automatically updates:
- Architectural decisions in DECISIONS.md
- Technical details when code changes
- Progress tracking in planning-docs/

### Manual Review Schedule

| Documentation Type | Review Frequency | Trigger Events |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Product specs | Per sprint | New features, requirement changes |
| Technical docs | Quarterly | Architecture changes, major refactors |
| Development guides | Bi-annually | Tool updates, team growth |
| Operations docs | After incidents | Outages, process improvements |
| Design docs | Per release | UI changes, rebrand |

## üí° Best Practices

### DO's ‚úÖ
1. **Start simple** - Begin with essential sections, expand over time
2. **Use examples** - Concrete examples are worth 1000 words
3. **Include diagrams** - Visual representations aid understanding
4. **Version control** - Track all documentation changes
5. **Link extensively** - Connect related documents
6. **Date updates** - Include "Last Updated" timestamps

### DON'Ts ‚ùå
1. **Don't duplicate** - Link to source of truth instead
2. **Don't overwrite** - Preserve history with versioning
3. **Don't neglect** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
4. **Don't gatekeep** - Make docs accessible to all who need them
5. **Don't perfectize** - Good enough today beats perfect tomorrow

## üé® Customization Examples

### For Startups
- Focus on: SPECIFICATIONS, SETUP, API_REFERENCE
- Minimize: DISASTER_RECOVERY, SCALING
- Combine: Merge similar docs to reduce overhead

### For Enterprise
- Expand: Add compliance sections, audit trails
- Separate: Split docs by team/department
- Automate: Generate from code where possible

### For Open Source
- Prioritize: SETUP, CONVENTIONS, API_REFERENCE
- Add: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Public: Make all non-sensitive docs public

## üìä Documentation Metrics

Track documentation health:

```markdown
## Documentation Coverage Scorecard

| Area | Coverage | Last Updated | Owner |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Product | 80% | 2024-01-15 | Product Team |
| Technical | 75% | 2024-01-10 | Dev Team |
| Development | 90% | 2024-01-05 | Tech Lead |
| Operations | 70% | 2024-01-12 | DevOps |
| Design | 60% | 2024-01-08 | Design Team |
```

## üöÄ Quick Start for New Projects

1. **Run setup script** - `./setup.sh` to initialize
2. **Fill critical docs first**:
   - PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (planning-docs/)
   - SETUP.md (development/)
   - API_REFERENCE.md or SYSTEM_DESIGN.md (technical/)
3. **Add as you grow** - Don't try to fill everything at once
4. **Review quarterly** - Set calendar reminders
