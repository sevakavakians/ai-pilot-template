# ü§ù Sharing Guide

How to share your AI Pilot Template configuration with your team and contribute improvements back to the community.

## Sharing with Your Team

### Option 1: Shared Repository (Recommended)

The best way to ensure team consistency is to commit the configuration to your project repository:

```bash
# In your project root
git add CLAUDE.md agents/ planning-docs/
git commit -m "Add AI Pilot Template configuration"
git push
```

Team members can then:
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone your-repo-url
cd your-project

# Install the agents locally
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Start working with Claude Code
claude code .
```

### Option 2: Configuration Package

Create a shareable configuration package:

```bash
# Create a config package
tar -czf ai-pilot-config.tar.gz \
  CLAUDE.md \
  agents/ \
  planning-docs/ \
  templates/

# Share via your preferred method
# Team members extract with:
tar -xzf ai-pilot-config.tar.gz
```

### Option 3: Team Standards Repository

Create a dedicated repository for team standards:

```bash
# Create team-standards repo
mkdir team-ai-standards
cd team-ai-standards

# Copy configurations
cp -r /path/to/ai-pilot-template/* .

# Customize for your team
vim TEAM_CONVENTIONS.md

# Push to shared location
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Team AI development standards"
git remote add origin your-team-repo
git push -u origin main
```

## Setting Up Team-Wide Standards

### 1. Customize Agent Behaviors

Edit agent configurations for your team's workflow:

```markdown
# In agents/project-manager.md
Add team-specific triggers:
- Code review completion
- Sprint planning events
- Daily standup summaries
```

### 2. Define Team Conventions

Create `TEAM_CONVENTIONS.md`:

```markdown
# Team AI Development Conventions

## Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: feat/fix/docs/chore
- Reference ticket numbers: "feat: add login [PROJ-123]"

## Documentation Updates
- Trigger project-manager after each PR merge
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md for any structural changes

## Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All PRs must pass test-analyst review
```

### 3. Standardize Commands

Ensure consistent commands across projects:

```bash
# In CLAUDE.md, standardize:
[BUILD_COMMAND] = "npm run build"
[TEST_COMMAND] = "npm test"
[LINT_COMMAND] = "npm run lint"
```

## Agent Installation for Team Members

### Automated Installation Script

Create `install-agents.sh` for your team:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Team agent installation script

CLAUDE_AGENTS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/agents"
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_AGENTS_DIR"

# Download team agents
curl -L https://your-team.com/agents/project-manager.md \
  -o "$CLAUDE_AGENTS_DIR/project-manager.md"

curl -L https://your-team.com/agents/test-analyst.md \
  -o "$CLAUDE_AGENTS_DIR/test-analyst.md"

echo "‚úÖ Team agents installed successfully!"
```

### Manual Installation

Share these instructions with your team:

1. **Download agent files** from team repository
2. **Copy to Claude Code directory**:
   ```bash
   cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

## Troubleshooting Shared Configurations

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agents not found | Ensure agents are in `~/.claude/agents/` |
| Different OS paths | Use environment variables |
| Version conflicts | Use tagged versions |
| Custom modifications lost | Maintain local overrides file |
| Team member confusion | Provide clear onboarding docs |
